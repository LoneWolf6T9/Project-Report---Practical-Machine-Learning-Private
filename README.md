# Project-Report---Practical-Machine-Learning-Private

This project report is for the project of course Practical Machine Learning by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The project name is "Predicting Exercise Performance with Machine Learning". I am a beginner in coding, still exploring domains and making myelf aware of different fields, aspects, etc of coding. I have made some minor projects before but this is my first ever project on GitHub. So I hope you like it.
