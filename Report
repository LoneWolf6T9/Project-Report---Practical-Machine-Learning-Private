Introduction
In the era of wearable fitness technology, the ability to quantify physical activity has become commonplace. Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit allow individuals to track the quantity of their exercise rigorously. However, the focus often lies in the measurement of activity volume, with little emphasis on the quality of the performance. This project seeks to address this gap by leveraging data from accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of participants. The goal is to predict the manner in which individuals perform barbell lifts — distinguishing between correct and incorrect execution in five distinct ways.

Importance & Context
Understanding the nuances of exercise performance is crucial for both fitness enthusiasts and those engaged in health-related technology. By delving into accelerometer data, we can unveil patterns and insights that go beyond mere activity tracking. This not only aids individuals in refining their workout routines for better health outcomes but also contributes to the broader field of quantified self, where meticulous self-measurement serves as a tool for self-improvement and behavioral pattern recognition.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to construct a predictive model capable of discerning the manner in which barbell lifts are executed. The variable of interest, denoted as "classe," encapsulates the diverse ways in which these exercises are performed. Through the utilization of machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a robust model that can accurately classify exercise performance based on accelerometer data obtained from different body parts.

As we embark on this journey into the realm of predictive analytics for exercise, our focus extends beyond mere quantification of physical activity. We aspire to contribute to the evolving landscape of personalized fitness insights, shedding light on the qualitative aspects of exercise execution.

The dataset utilized in this project originates from the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset, sourced from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. The dataset captures accelerometer data from various body parts, including the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell. Participants were instructed to perform barbell lifts in both correct and incorrect ways, resulting in a diverse set of labeled instances.

The dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring the intersection of machine learning and exercise science. With features derived from accelerometer readings, it presents an opportunity to train models that can discern subtle variations in exercise execution. The participants' diverse movements offer a rich landscape for predictive modeling, aiming to enhance our understanding of how accelerometer data can be leveraged to predict the quality of physical activities.

As we delve into the intricacies of this dataset, we embark on a journey to bridge the gap between quantitative tracking and qualitative assessment, ultimately contributing to the advancement of personalized fitness analytics.

Data Exploration
In this section, we will load and explore the training and test datasets, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the available data.

- Code :
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load training and test datasets
train_data <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
test_data <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

# Display basic information about the datasets
str(train_data)
str(test_data)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(train_data))
sum(is.na(test_data))

# Display basic statistics
summary(train_data)

# Visualize key aspects of the data
# Example: Distribution of the 'classe' variable
ggplot(train_data, aes(x = classe, fill = classe)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Classe Variable",
       x = "Classe",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

- This R code accomplishes the following :
• Loading Data : The read.csv function is used to load the training and test datasets into R.
• Structure and Missing Values : The str function provides an overview of the structure of the datasets, including data types. The sum(is.na(...)) commands check for missing values in both datasets.
• Basic Statistics : The summary function provides basic statistical summaries of the training dataset, offering insights into central tendencies and distributions.
• Visualization : The ggplot function from the tidyverse package is employed to visualize key aspects of the data. The example code visualizes the distribution of the 'classe' variable.

Data Cleaning & Processing

- Code :

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load training and test datasets
train_data <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
test_data <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

# Remove irrelevant or redundant features
# In this example, we remove columns with near-zero variance
train_data_clean <- train_data %>%
  select(-nearZeroVar(.))

# Handle missing values
# In this example, we remove columns with more than 50% missing values
train_data_clean <- train_data_clean %>%
  select(names(which(colMeans(is.na(.)) < 0.5)))

# Convert the "classe" variable to a factor
train_data_clean$classe <- as.factor(train_data_clean$classe)

# Check the structure of the cleaned dataset
str(train_data_clean)

- In this code:
• Remove Irrelevant or Redundant Features: The nearZeroVar function from the caret package is used to identify and remove columns with near-zero variance. This helps in getting rid of features that may not contribute much to the predictive power of the model.
• Handle Missing Values: The colMeans(is.na(.)) < 0.5 condition is used to select columns with less than 50% missing values. This threshold can be adjusted based on your specific requirements. Columns with more than 50% missing values are removed.
• Convert "classe" Variable to Factor: The as.factor function is used to convert the "classe" variable to a factor, which is essential for building a classification model.

Data Splitting : Split the training dataset into training and validation sets.

- Code :

# Load necessary libraries
library(caret)

# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Load the cleaned training dataset
train_data_clean <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")

# Split the training dataset into training and validation sets (80% training, 20% validation)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(train_data_clean$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
training_set <- train_data_clean[trainIndex, ]
validation_set <- train_data_clean[-trainIndex, ]

# Check the dimensions of the sets
dim(training_set)
dim(validation_set)

- In this code :
• Setting Seed : set.seed(123) ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed. You can choose any seed value.
• Load Cleaned Training Dataset: If you've been following the previous steps, the cleaned training dataset (train_data_clean) should already be available.
• Split Dataset : The createDataPartition function from the caret package is used to split the dataset. The parameter p specifies the proportion of the dataset to include in the training set (80% in this case). The resulting trainIndex is then used to create the training and validation sets.
• Check Dimensions : Finally, we check the dimensions of the training and validation sets to ensure that the split was successful.

Model Building : Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs are known for their effectiveness in handling complex decision boundaries. Let's use the svm function from the e1071 package to build an SVM model.
- Code :

# Load necessary libraries
library(e1071)

# Ensure that the "classe" variable is a factor
training_set$classe <- as.factor(training_set$classe)

# Define the features and the target variable
features <- names(training_set)[-ncol(training_set)]
target <- "classe"

# Build the SVM model
svm_model <- svm(
  formula = as.formula(paste(target, "~", paste(features, collapse = "+"))),
  data = training_set
)

# Display a summary of the model
print(svm_model)

- In this code :
• Load Necessary Libraries : We load the e1071 library, which provides the svm function for Support Vector Machines.
• Ensure "classe" Variable is a Factor : This is a precautionary step to ensure that the target variable is treated as a factor by the SVM model.
• Define Features and Target Variable : We define the features and the target variable for the model.
• Build SVM Model : The svm function is used to build the SVM model. The formula specifies the relationship between the target variable and the features. The resulting model (svm_model) is printed to display a summary.

Model Evalutation 

- Code :

# Load necessary libraries
library(caret)

# Ensure that the "classe" variable is a factor in the validation set
validation_set$classe <- as.factor(validation_set$classe)

# Predictions on the validation set
validation_predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = validation_set)

# Evaluate performance metrics
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(validation_predictions, validation_set$classe)
print(conf_matrix)

# Cross-validation
set.seed(123)
cv_results <- train(
  x = training_set[, features, drop = FALSE],
  y = training_set[, target],
  method = "rf",  # Change to "xgbTree" for XGBoost, or "svmRadial" for SVM
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, verboseIter = TRUE)
)

# Display cross-validation results
print(cv_results)

- In this code:
• Ensure "classe" Variable is a Factor in the Validation Set : This is a precautionary step to ensure that the target variable is treated as a factor in the validation set.
• Predictions on the Validation Set : We use the trained Random Forest model to make predictions on the validation set.
• Evaluate Performance Metrics : The confusionMatrix function from the caret package is used to calculate and print various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
• Cross-validation : The train function from the caret package is used to perform cross-validation. This involves training the model on different subsets of the training data and evaluating its performance. The method parameter can be adjusted for different algorithms (e.g., "xgbTree" for XGBoost or "svmRadial" for SVM).

Prediction for TestData

- Code :

# Load necessary libraries
library(tibble)

# Load the test dataset
test_data <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

# Ensure that the "classe" variable is a factor
test_data$classe <- as.factor(test_data$classe)

# Predictions on the test set
test_predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = test_data)

# Prepare predictions for submission
submission_df <- tibble(ID = test_data$X, classe = test_predictions)

# Display the submission dataframe
print(submission_df)

# Save predictions to a CSV file (adjust the file path as needed)
write.csv(submission_df, file = "predictions_submission.csv", row.names = FALSE)

In this code :
• Ensure "classe" Variable is a Factor in the Test Set : This is a precautionary step to ensure that the target variable is treated as a factor in the test set.
• Predictions on the Test Set : We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
• Prepare Predictions for Submission : The predictions are stored in a tibble (a modern version of a data frame in the tibble package) with the appropriate format for submission. The "ID" column corresponds to the test case ID, and the "classe" column contains the predicted class.
• Display the Submission Dataframe : The prepared dataframe is printed to the console.
• Save Predictions to a CSV File : The predictions are saved to a CSV file, which you can use for submission.
